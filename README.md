# Public front end

## 1st View

On first load, the user will be put on the home page with 2 tabs. 1 for information about the program and one to filter students to find similar students to the user.

1.0 Cards will display various statistics about the program, and have a hide button in the form of a carat to hide the graph. Additionally the charts are interactive in the sense that clicking on a field allows you to hide it from the representation.

1.3 From here a user can select or unselect a displayed checkbox. They can also press the ADD MORE buttons to create a search field to query all possible values for a specific filter. This autocomplete field will search any partial matches of what is entered into it. When an option is selected, it is added to the list and a user can select it

1.4 Last, but not least, when on the public front end graphs page a button that says questions floats in the bottom right. When pressed a window for a chatbot that can answer questions about the program pops up. The chatbot can be hidden by pressing the hide button.
